            Iconography, Form and Semiotics
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph={true}>
        In the realm of multimodal rhetoric, the chess club poster serves as a compelling case study in the art of visual communication.
        By incorporating semiotic principles, the poster deftly employs icons, symbols, and indexes to convey its message.
        The logotype's chess piece icons iconically represent the game's essence. To be more precise, the Chess Club's logo contains chess board and a pawn that represents the main idea of the club. the black and white board is the demonstration of the balance and the strategy that could be used during the chess game. It is a very subtle reference that might be ignored but we need to take into account that the connotation of the logo might be quite confused for the beginners and new members. Then, the wreaths can be understand as elitism and loyalty that can deliver us 17-19th centuries history when the chess was available for the 'white bones' (people with high social status). 
        The slogan symbolically elevates chess to the status of an art, science, and sport. There is no any secret as in logo but the slogan makes it fire for those who understand the chess. Of course, chess is more than just a fun game.
        Lastly, mentioning the huge white pawn is mandatory here. This icon will resemble us something related to our past memories, for example, in childhood when our grandpa and dad was playing chess. These memories build the closer relationship to this icon so we can be interested in it and take a part in this club. 
        Also, icon is perfectly placed and sized to get paid attention.
